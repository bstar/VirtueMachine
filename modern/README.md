# Modern Port Workspace

All new implementation work goes here.

## Directories

- `sim-core/`: authoritative gameplay simulation
- `platform/`: platform abstraction and adapters
- `client-web/`: renderer/UI/web runtime
- `tools/`: migration, replay, diagnostics tools

## Constraint

Do not modify `legacy/u6-decompiled/SRC/` during normal development.
Use the submodule as reference input and preserve it as baseline.
