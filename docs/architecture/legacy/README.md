# Legacy Architecture Docs

This directory captures what the original game does, how subsystems interact, and how confident we are in each interpretation.

## Files

- `module-map.md`: segment-level and subsystem-level map.
- `symbol-catalog.md`: decompiled symbol meaning/rename tracking.

## Usage

- Treat this as factual/provenance documentation.
- Avoid placing modernization decisions here; put those under `../new/`.
- Link findings from `../../research/legacy-findings.md`.
