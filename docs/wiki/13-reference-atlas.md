## Why This Matters

This atlas is intentionally player-outcome focused.  
Each term is documented not just by definition, but by:

- what it looks like when correct,
- what fails when wrong,
- what to inspect first during triage.

## Atlas Curation Rule

Atlas entries are intentional, not automatic.

That means:

- only terms with real diagnostic or architectural value should be added,
- section headings are not auto-promoted to Atlas entries,
- if a heading should be Atlas-worthy, add it explicitly with curated context.
